# Pokémon 

## Overview
This project, part of CS50's Introduction to Game Development course, provided by Harvard University. It builds upon the Pokémon source code from Lecture 7 to implement a level-up menu feature for player Pokémon.

Resource: https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/weeks/7/

## Objectives
- Thoroughly understand all of the Pokémon source code from Lecture 7.
- Implement a level-up menu showing the updated stats in the ‘X + Y = Z’ format.

## Specification
Implement a Menu to be displayed during the player Pokémon's level up. It should appear right after the “Level Up” dialogue at the end of a victory where the player has indeed leveled up. The implementation takes place in the :victory() function of the TakeTurnState.
